# nlp-categorization-of-news
Using NLP to find out the categories of news that drive media.
A word cloud is made at the end which shows us the most used words from the dataset. Hence we can clearly understand that what type of news actually gains most attention.

**Further things to do**
Use K-Means clustering to group similar words into clusters. Then find out which cluster appeared most in the dataset to actually conclude the categories of news that drive media
